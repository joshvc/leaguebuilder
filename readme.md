A simple app that takes in a league and any number of teams, and returns a round-robin set of fixtures.

TODOs:
* Take in game results and return standings
* I've wanted to try a swiss pairing algorithm for a while
* If this were to be a commercial venture, real login/private leagues would probably be good
* Oh, and design would help.
